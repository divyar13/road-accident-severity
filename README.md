# Road Accident Severity Prediction

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Road accidents are a major global concern, causing numerous fatalities and injuries annually. This project aims to predict the severity of road accidents using machine learning techniques, helping to mitigate risks and provide insights for safer road conditions. The project compares several algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using data from the United States.

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the severity of road accidents using machine learning algorithms. The model helps traffic management systems in reducing accident risks by identifying high-risk areas and providing real-time traffic flow information.

## Dataset
